# Portfolio

This is a static front-end project made by *Umair Ali Bhutto*.

## Getting started 

To get started with this project you need to open your project directory and double click on index.html file in your project folder.
This will open your file in your browser.

## Deployed

This Website is already deployed on my site [HERE](https://umairalibhutto254.000webhostapp.com/portfolio/)

## Development 

If you want to edit the index.html file open it in any editor you have access to but i would recommend visual studio code [VS-code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
After that you can edit the contents of the pages.
Note: kindly do remember that the images used in the project or any images that you will induce the upcoming future have been compressed and converted to webp format for more information on webp you 
can go to [webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp).

for Compression i have used [imagecompressor](https://imagecompressor.11zon.com/en/compress-webp/).

for conversion i have used [convert](https://converter.11zon.com/en/image-to-webp/)
and [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/).
